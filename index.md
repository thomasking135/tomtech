## Welcome to TomTech


Hi I'm Tom, a young web developer from Christchurch, New Zealand. I'm passionate about web development and design and the impression a good site makes on people. For a web site that stands out from the crowd, let's make some magic! 

### Design
At the heart of the great website is beauty. A picture paints a 1000 words and a website paints perhaps even more. We have the ability to design sites which have that wow factor! 


### Functionality

In this busy world we're living in functionality matters. Our sites are reliable and will never leave your audience in suspense. Our clear and simple sites will perform precisely when and where expected!



For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/thomasking135/tomtech/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact
